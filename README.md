# Bailey's Password Generator Code Refractor


## Description
This password generator uses refractored code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web API's to randomly generate a password. When the user gives specific criteria like password length, and agrees to whether or not they would like to include uppercase, lowercase, and special characters while following window alerts or prompts, the password is generated. The randomized password is an array of different characters give a secure password for the user based on the met criteria shown through window alerts or prompts. 

In JavaScript a for loop, if statements and different logistical functions were used to ensure randomization based on the selected or agreed upon characters. If a person does not agree to one of the prompts, the pool of characters will narrow, but the password will still generate with the smaller pool of characters.
